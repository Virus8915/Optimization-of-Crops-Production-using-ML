# Optimization-of-Crops-Production-using-ML

Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures eventually reduce yields of desirable crops
while encouraging weed and pest proliferation. Climate change can disrupt food availability, reduce access to food,
and affect food quality. For example, projected increases in temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, 
changes in extreme weather events, and reductions in water availability may all result in reduced agricultural productivity.

I have build a ML Model to optimize the agricultural production depends on various factors i.e., Nitrogen, Phosphorous, 
Potassium, Temperature, Relative Humidity, PH Value and Rainfall present in given dataset.
